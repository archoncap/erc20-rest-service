# BitDegree Smart Contracts

#### Good News for Bug Hunters — BitDegree Smart Contracts are Public!

We have started a Smart Contract Bug Bounty Campaign with a massive reward of 5,000,000 BitDegree tokens (BDG); the equivalent of more than $150 000 USD. Use your skills to audit, fix bugs, and find any other possible technical issues with BitDegree smart contracts. Find them, then [submit them all here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfikArEasm0yvltO6I68qiW9mchD70kL-GRFH1R_IYHjtfWtg/viewform).
The discovery of:

* **Low severity bugs** (optimization and minor improvements) will be rewarded with **10,000 BDG**.
* **Medium-severity bugs**, which do not affect balances, will be rewarded with **50,000 BDG**.
* **Severe bugs**, which provide ability to steal ether and/or tokens, will be rewarded with a huge **1,000,000 BDG**.

The terms and conditions are very simple: every contribution must be constructive and useful. **Every** accepted functionality improvement will be rewarded, and every found and fixed bug **will be rewarded**.

So, what are you waiting for? Give it a try, and claim your reward!
